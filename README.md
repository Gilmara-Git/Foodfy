## About
Foodfy is a Web Application project to manage Recipes and Chefs.

## Learning Objectives
- Recipes can be created edited and deleted as long as there is no image on the recipe profile. 
- Chefs can be created, edited and deleted **when** there is no **recipe** tied to it. 
- Postgres database is being used to store data persistently.

Extra features implemented on this application:
- **For recipes**:
Applied a filter to the main page and on the Admin Index page. So, user can search by recipe's name. 
- Applied pagination on the Admin Index page.
- Implemented a validation for when user wants to delete a recipe. 
If a recipe contains images, there will be a message advising to remove recipe's images first. 
Then recipe can be removed from the system. 
- Applied a redirection to Home page when user clicks on the Foodfy Logo.


- **For chefs**:
Applied a filter on chef's Admin Index page. So, user can search by chefs' name.
